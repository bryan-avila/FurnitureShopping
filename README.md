# What is this?
This is an Android App that allows users to select between two versions of an app, to see which version provides a better shopping experience. However, this is **not an official shopping app**, it is _merely a showcase_ of two ways to design a shopping application.

Version 1 provides users with images of furniture that they can use to navigate around the app as they "shop".

Version 2 provides users with drop-down menus instead of images that they use to navigate through the app.

Both versions take note to implement [Fitt's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts%27s_law), which should still allow fast navigation in either version.

This project was originally made as a Human Computer Interaction class project.
