# About?
This is an Android App written in Java that allows users to interact with two versions of this furniture shopping app. However, this is **not an official/functional app**, it is _merely a showcase_ of two ways to design a shopping application.

Version 1 provides users with drop-down menus that are used to navigate through the app.

Version 2 provides images of the furniture that help navigate through the app. 

Both versions follow [Fitt's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts%27s_law), spacing out elements appropriately and placing elements in spots that are easy to tap.
