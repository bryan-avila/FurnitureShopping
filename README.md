# About
This is an Android App written in Java that allows users to interact with two versions of this furniture shopping app. 

However, this is **not an official/functional shopping application**, it is _merely a showcase_ of two ways to design a shopping application.

Version 1 _(left in preview)_ provides users with drop-down menus that are used to navigate through the app.

Version 2 _(right in preview)_ provides images of the furniture that help navigate through the app. 

Both versions follow [Fitt's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts%27s_law), spacing out elements appropriately and placing elements in spots that are easy to tap.

Prices, materials, estimated times, inventory, etc. used in this app were devised solely for demonstration purposes, since this is NOT an official shopping application.

This project was originally made for a Human Computer Interaction class project. This is an updated version.
